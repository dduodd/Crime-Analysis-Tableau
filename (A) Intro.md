# Crime-Analysis-Tableau-one-

  This is an Data Visualization Project. The goal is to simply - mess around with visualization. And because I had access to Tableau during this period, why not use Tableau?
So, this is an in-depth crime analysis about crimes from 2003-2015 
(eg. Most/least common crime type, increase/decrease in what types of crime, frequency of different crime types over time, resolutions, race of victims and perpetrators, etc.). 
After cleaning the data, I simply threw it into Tableau and created visualizations. And from here, I created a storyboard to present for my make-belive presentation (I know, embarrassing). 

Unfortunately, because some of the files are from Tableau, I can't upload it since the file are to big. I also can't upload the dataset for the same reason (have .csv and .json).

So if you want the file, I would be more then happy to email it to you - email: dz115471@gmail.com 
(please remeber to include that you came from github, else, I might ignore you)
